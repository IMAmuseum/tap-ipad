# TAP iPad
Welcome to the TAP iPad app!

This documentation will be more useful with the benefit of context. The TAP iPad app was first developed at the IMA for use as a kiosk-type app for in-gallery use during marquee exhibitions. It has three basic view types, a 'timeline' view which maps a series of event stops to events mapped out on a horizontally scrolling timeline, a 'themes' view which presents a grid of an arbitrary number of, you guessed it, 'themes,' which then allow the user to drill into a group of stops containing content around that theme, and a 'theme' view, which is just the singular view that the themes view drills into.

These views are backed by TourML data (in our case generated using the TAP CMS) corresponding to the views in the following structure:
