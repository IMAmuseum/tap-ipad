        <div class="content">One of China’s most provocative and vocal artists, Ai Weiwei’s focus on human rights and social change eventually led to his nearly three-month
            detainment by Chinese authorities and ongoing surveillance, which have influenced his work enormously. Curator of contemporary art Sarah Urist Green discusses
            the IMA’s exhibition, which includes examples from the broad spectrum of the artist’s practice—ranging from sculpture, photography, and video to site-specific
            architectural installations.</div>

            Their music has been described by <em>The Guardian</em> as “irreverent and un-PC,” a world-ranging mix of punk and Hindi lyrics, bhangra, and other South Asian beats. The Kominas claims “they are just trying to show
            both cultures how broad the spectrum of belief can be.” (CNN)</div>
